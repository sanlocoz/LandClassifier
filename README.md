# LandClassifier

## What is this program about?
This program is to implement basic remote sensing for land use system.
I also try to use object-oriented paradigm in developing the module.


## Algorithms and concepts
The module comprises a main data structure model that is <a href= "https://sanlocoz.github.io/LandClassifier/#LandClassifier.RasterMap"> RasterMap</a>.
>*RasterMap*<br>
>is a class that represents raster map with a total pixel of totalX * totalY. Each cell is pixelsizeX by pixelsizeY in size. Each cell can contains multivalue that given in array-like value in **kwargs.


Classify land use using K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm


## Sample graphical output of the classification

## What to do next?

## Further information
The detail functionality of the module can be found <a href= "https://sanlocoz.github.io/LandClassifier/"> here</a>.
